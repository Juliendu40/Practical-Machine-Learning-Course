This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.


LOADIND DATA:

We load the caret package as well as the data provided to create the training and testing sets

```{r}

library(caret)

trainURL <- "http://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-training.csv"
testURL <- "http://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-testing.csv"
trainSet <- read.csv(url(trainURL))
testSet <- read.csv(url(testURL))
```

We get more info about our data and the features

```{r}

str(trainSet)

```

- There are 160 features, we need to reduce this amount
- Many features include NA values
- Many features are not relevant 


CLEANING DATA

- We remove the first 7 features that are related to the user and are therefore unrelevant
- We remove features containing NA values
- We remove variables with no variance


```{r}
trainSet <- trainSet[, -(1:7)]
trainSet <- trainSet[ , colSums(is.na(trainSet)) == 0]
nearZeroVar <- nearZeroVar(trainSet)
trainSet <- trainSet[, -nearZeroVar]
dim(trainSet)


```

We have reduced the number of variables to 53


CROSS VALIDATION

We split the data into the training and test set


```{r}

set.seed(2)
inTrain <- createDataPartition(y=trainSet$classe, p=0.70, list=FALSE)
training  <- trainSet[inTrain,]
testing  <- trainSet[-inTrain,]

```


MODEL

We start to fit a predictive model  using Random Forest because it automatically selects important variables, which is suitable in our case since we have 53 variables. 

We will see if the accuracy is high enough or if we should try another model

```{r}
model <- train(classe~.,data=training,method="rf")
predictions <- predict(model, newdata = testing)
confusionMatrix(predictions, testing$classe)
```


We get very good results using Random Forest with a 0.9935 accuracy.
We can apply this model to predict the 20 quiz results 

```{r}
quizPred <- predict(model, newdata=testSet)
quizPred

```
